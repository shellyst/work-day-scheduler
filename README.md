# Work Day Scheduler - Third Party APIs

## This project was created for Week 5: Work Day Scheduler Challenge.

## Project Summary and Functionality

This quiz was created with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Moment.js, and performs the following functionality:

1. When the planner is opened, the current date is displayed at the top of the calendar.

2. When a user scrolls, they are presented with blocks of time for each hour in a standard business day. (9am - 5pm)

3. Each time block is colour-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

4. Events can be entered into the timeblocks, and saved using the save button.

5. The save button saves the event to local storage, and if the page is refreshed, the page content persists.
